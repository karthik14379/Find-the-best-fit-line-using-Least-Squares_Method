# Find-the-best-fit-line-using-Least-Squares_Method
## AIM:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
2. Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
3. Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula.

4. Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:

">
5. Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line. 6. Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.
